                <p><span class=" font-bold">var : </span> The var keyword in JavaScript is used to declare variables.
                    Variables
                    declared with var have function-level scope, which means they are accessible throughout the function
                    in which
                    they are declared, or globally if declared outside of any function.</p> <br>

                <p><span class=" font-bold">let : </span> In JavaScript, the let keyword is used to declare variables
                    with block
                    scope. Variables declared with let are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression in
                    which they are
                    defined. This means that they are only accessible within the block they are declared in, and they
                    don't hoist to
                    the top of their containing function or global scope like variables declared with var do.</p> <br>
                <p><span class=" font-bold">const : </span>In JavaScript, the const keyword is used to declare
                    variables, but
                    unlike let, variables declared with const are constant. This means their values cannot be reassigned
                    once they
                    are initialized. Additionally, const variables also have block scope, just like let</p>

            <hr>
            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">undefined</span> An "undefined" value in JavaScript typically means that a
                variable has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value, or a function returns nothing explicitly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">null</span> A "null" value, on the other hand, is a deliberate value that
                indicates the absence of an object or the intention to have no value. It's often used when you want to
                clear or reset a variable.

                <span class="font-bold"> REST API</span> A REST API is a standardized way for computer systems to
                communicate over the internet. It uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform actions
                on resources (data or services). REST APIs are stateless, have a uniform interface, and are widely used
                for web and mobile app development.
